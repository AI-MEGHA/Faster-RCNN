# Faster-RCNN
Faster-rcnn is one of the most classic algorithms in the field of object detection. It mainly consists of two parts. One is a deep full convolutional network for generating candidate area frames, and the other is a Fast R-CNN detection model. The two share parameters during training. Faster R-CNN can solve the problem that Fast RCNN uses the third-party tool selective search to extract the region proposal. It uses RPN instead of selective search to make the entire target detection function into a unified network.
